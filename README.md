This repository contains the code for the Group Level Analysis of autistic and
healthy subjects for the project: *Resting-State Functional Connectivity analysis
of Autistic Individuals*, where the aim is to find the statistically significant
Functional Connectivity link differences between autistic and healthy subjects,
by regressing out the confounds such as IQ, handedness etc.

This repo is an extension of [Autism Connectome Analysis](
https://github.com/varun-invent/Autism-Connectome-Analysis/tree/varun) where the
details of another attempt to find statistically significant link differences can
be found, along with pre-processing details.
